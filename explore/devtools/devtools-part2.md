## Part 3 Questions

### 1. What was the bug?

*Answer:*  The inputs were taken as strings instead of int, so they would combine the strings instead of adding the values. 

### 2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.

*Answer:*  I would just add the parseInt() function to be able to convert the strings to integers.
